Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting language processing, poses significant challenges in both academic and personal spheres. Despite its prevalence and impact, diagnosing
dyslexia remains a complex task, often relying on subjective evaluations and standardized tests that
may not fully capture its nuances. This project addresses these diagnostic challenges by proposing a novel approach: leveraging advanced machine learning methods, specifically Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect dyslexia biomarkers through handwritten images. By focusing
on the unique patterns and characteristics present in the handwriting of individuals with dyslexia,
our web-based machine learning project offers a promising avenue for more accurate and efficient
diagnosis. Through the utilization of CNNs, renowned for their effectiveness in image recognition
tasks, our system can analyze handwriting samples with unprecedented precision, identifying subtle indicators indicative of dyslexia. This innovative approach not only streamlines the diagnostic
process but also has the potential to facilitate early intervention and support for individuals with
dyslexia, ultimately improving their academic and personal outcomes
